# Hello, world! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Himel Mallick. I am a computational biologist currently working at Merck Research Laboratoriees. I am an extended [lab member](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/) of the [bioBakery software development team](https://github.com/biobakery) at the [Harvard Chan School](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) and the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). 

As background, I am a Julia enthusiast, a Python explorer, and an R developer. Mostly, I develop computational methods and open-source software for the analysis of high-dimensional data, including high-throughput next-generation sequencing data.
