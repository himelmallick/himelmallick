# Hello, World! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Himel is a tenure-track Principal Investigator researching at [Cornell University's](https://www.cornell.edu/) [Department of Population Health Sciences](https://weill.cornell.edu/units/population-health-sciences). He develops computational methods to generate and validate testable hypotheses that accelerate data-driven discovery. Prior to Cornell, Himel was an Associate Principal Scientist at Merck Research Laboratories and a postdoctoral fellow of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Harvard University.

Himel holds a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Statistics from the University of Calcutta and a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Statistics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. He earned his Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).

As background, Himel is a Julia enthusiast, a Python explorer, and an R developer. Mostly, he develops computational methods and open-source software for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics data with a particular emphasis on microbiome multi-omics and multimodal single-cell RNA sequencing data. Himel is also an extended [lab member](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/) of the [bioBakery software development team](https://github.com/biobakery) at the [Harvard Chan School](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) and the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). 

He is a [Fellow of the American Statistical Association (FASA)](https://www.amstat.org/your-career/awards/asa-fellows) and a recipient of the [IISA Early Career Award in Statistics and Data Sciences](https://www.intindstat.org/statistical-awards) .
